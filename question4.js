// Q.4 What are the major features introduced in ECMAScript6?

// ECMAScript 6 (also known as ES6 or ECMAScript 2015) introduced several new features and enhancements to JavaScript. Some of the major features introduced in ECMAScript 6 include:

// Arrow Functions: Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing function expressions. They have a more compact syntax and lexically bind the this value, making it easier to write and understand functions.

// Block-Scoped Declarations: The let and const keywords were introduced to declare variables with block scope, which helps avoid issues related to variable hoisting and provides more predictable scoping behavior.

// Classes: ES6 introduced a more structured syntax for creating classes in JavaScript, including support for constructors, inheritance, and super calls. This makes it easier to work with object-oriented programming patterns.

// Modules: ES6 introduced native support for modules, allowing developers to organize their code into separate files and share functionality between them. Modules have their own scope and can explicitly export and import functions, objects, or values.

// Template Literals: Template literals provide a new way to create strings in JavaScript, allowing multi-line strings and embedded expressions using the ${} syntax. This makes it easier to write complex strings and perform string interpolation.

// Destructuring Assignment: Destructuring assignment allows you to extract values from arrays or objects into individual variables, providing a more concise and readable way to work with complex data structures.

// Enhanced Object Literals: Object literals were enhanced to provide new features such as concise syntax for defining methods, shorthand property definitions, computed property names, and the ability to set the prototype of an object.

// Promises: Promises are a new way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript, providing a cleaner and more structured approach compared to traditional callback-based techniques. Promises simplify error handling and chaining of asynchronous operations.

// Default Parameters: ES6 introduced the ability to specify default values for function parameters, which are used when the corresponding argument is omitted or undefined. This helps simplify function definitions and provides better control over default behavior.

// Iterators and Generators: Iterators and generators were introduced to provide a standardized way to iterate over collections and create custom iterable objects. They enable the use of for...of loops and simplify asynchronous programming.

// These are just some of the major features introduced in ECMAScript 6. ES6 brought significant improvements to the JavaScript language, enhancing its capabilities and making it more expressive and developer-friendly.
